# load CC/IN2P3 environnement
source setup_ccin2p3.sh

# build the demo program
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make
cd ../

# run demo with a RED file
build/read_red -i $RED_PATH/snemo_run-612_red.data.gz

# create your own program
cp read_red.cxx my_red_analysis.cxx
cd build/
cmake ../   # do only once, to update the Makefile with new rule for my_red_analysis compilation
make
cd ../

Better to work on RED files, unless you know what you want to do with RTD.
